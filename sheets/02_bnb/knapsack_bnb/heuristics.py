Heuristics Module

In branch-and-bound, a relaxation gives an upper bound on the best objective in a branch.
To tighten pruning, you need feasible (integral) solutions to serve as lower bounds.
Instead of waiting for an integral node, you can derive feasible solutions from the relaxation
(e.g., rounding, greedy inclusion) to improve search efficiency.

You can implement heuristics by subclassing `Heuristics` and overriding `search(instance, node)`.
`search` should yield zero or more feasible `RelaxedSolution` objects.
